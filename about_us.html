                    Dave founded TravelTips in 1989 after an illuminating night out in Bruges. Ever since then he has sought out new experiences and is passionate about passing this knowledge on to others.
                    Dave is responsible for selecting and curating the experiences you will find on this site.

                    Barry had never left the country until a small misunderstanding with the tax authorities in early 2010. He now works remotely from all over the globe, seeking out and documenting
                    the best travel experiences money can buy. If one of our hand-picked experiences resonates with you, you have Barry to thank!
